# PHP Configuration for MKPRIME on GoDaddy Hosting

## Email Configuration (Gmail SMTP)

To use Gmail SMTP, you need to create an App Password:

1. Go to your Google Account: https://myaccount.google.com/
2. Select "Security" from the left menu
3. Under "Signing in to Google," select "2-Step Verification" (you must enable this first)
4. Scroll to the bottom and select "App passwords"
5. Select "Mail" as the app and "Other" as the device
6. Name it "MKPRIME Website" and click "Generate"
7. Copy the 16-character password (no spaces)
8. Use this password in the config.php file

## Configuration Steps

1. Open `api/config.php`
2. Replace the following values:
   - SMTP_USERNAME: your-gmail@gmail.com
   - SMTP_PASSWORD: your-16-character-app-password
   - SMTP_FROM_EMAIL: your-gmail@gmail.com

Example:
```php
define('SMTP_USERNAME', 'mkprime@gmail.com');
define('SMTP_PASSWORD', 'abcd efgh ijkl mnop'); // 16-character app password
define('SMTP_FROM_EMAIL', 'mkprime@gmail.com');
```

## File Upload Configuration

The following are already configured in config.php:
- Maximum file size: 5MB
- Allowed image types: JPEG, JPG, PNG, GIF
- Allowed CV types: PDF, DOC, DOCX
- Upload directory: public_html root

## GoDaddy-Specific Settings

### File Permissions
After uploading to GoDaddy, set these permissions:
- Directories: 755
- PHP files: 644
- .htaccess: 644
- Upload directory: 777 (if separate)

### PHP Settings
GoDaddy should have these enabled by default:
- PHP version: 7.4 or higher
- file_uploads: On
- upload_max_filesize: 5M or higher
- post_max_size: 6M or higher
- max_execution_time: 300 or higher

You can check these in GoDaddy cPanel > PHP Settings

## Testing Email Configuration

After configuring, test the contact form:
1. Visit your website
2. Fill out the contact form
3. Submit and check if email is received
4. Check spam folder if not in inbox
5. If errors occur, check error_log.txt in public_html

## Troubleshooting

### Email not sending:
- Verify Gmail App Password is correct (16 characters, no spaces)
- Verify 2-Step Verification is enabled on Gmail account
- Check if Gmail is blocking the connection (check Gmail security alerts)
- Try using port 465 with SSL instead of 587 with TLS

### File upload not working:
- Check directory permissions (should be 755 or 777)
- Verify PHP upload settings in cPanel
- Check error_log.txt for specific errors

### 404 errors on page navigation:
- Verify .htaccess file is uploaded
- Check if mod_rewrite is enabled in cPanel
- Verify .htaccess has correct permissions (644)

## Security Notes

- Never commit config.php with real credentials to version control
- Keep config.php secure and not web-accessible (protected by .htaccess)
- Use strong, unique App Password
- Regularly rotate App Passwords
- Monitor error_log.txt for suspicious activity
